IMITATION LEARNING FOR VISUAL SERVOING TOWARDS A SPECIFIC OBJECT USING A 7DOF MANIPULATOR.


The Python package uses Stanford CNN API as a base for training of the NN models. 

i. Servoing_data.py is used to collect and label the training images while the manipulator is being teleoperated by a human expert. The data is stored in folder Dataset.

ii. One of the CNN/FC models can be run by declaring a correspondin object and running the solvers afterwards.

iii. Hyperparameters have already been specified in the programs and don't need to be cross-validated.
